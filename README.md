# FRED_API_Observation_Processor README

A Python script to read St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank Observations and insert them into a database. 

## Setup

This section will cover the setup and dependencies required to run the processor.

Ensure [Python 3.5][python] and Python package manager [PIP][pip] has been installed on your system.

Once PIP has been installed, install the following modules:

    pip install --user datetime
    pip install --user requests
    pip install --user configparser
    pip install --user psycopg2

Create or initialize a local Postgres database and run the script "FRED_Project/postgres/DDL/Create_Tables.sql" to initialize the example database tables.

Create an account for [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis][FRED] and request an API key to query the FRED API.

Once the database has been setup and an API key obtained, use the provided example configuration file "FRED_Project/config/config.example.ini" to create a configuration file named "FRED_Project/config/config.ini".  Populate with the appropriate database and login information. 

Once the setup is complete, the main file may be run using the command:

    python3.5 main.py
